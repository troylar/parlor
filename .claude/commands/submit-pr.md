# /submit-pr Skill

Run a full validation suite on the current branch and create a pull request with a well-structured description. This is the single skill for "validate and submit my work."

## Usage

```
/submit-pr                          # Submit PR against main
/submit-pr develop                  # Submit PR against a specific base branch
/submit-pr --skip-checks            # Skip validation (not recommended)
/submit-pr --draft                  # Create as draft PR
/submit-pr --checks-only            # Run all checks but don't create the PR
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-flight (parallel)

**A — Branch status:**
```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git log --oneline main..HEAD
```

**B — Remote status:**
```bash
git remote -v
git rev-list --left-right --count main...HEAD
```

**C — Merge conflicts:**
```bash
git merge-tree $(git merge-base main HEAD) main HEAD
```

Verify:
- We're on a feature branch (not main)
- There are commits ahead of the base branch
- No uncommitted changes (warn if present, suggest committing first)
- Branch can merge cleanly (if not, list conflicting files)

### Step 2: Extract Issue References

From the branch name and all commits, collect issue references:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git log --oneline main..HEAD
```

- Extract all `#N` references from commit messages
- Extract issue number from branch name (`issue-<N>-...`)
- Deduplicate
- Verify each issue exists:
  ```bash
  gh issue view <N> --json state,title --jq '"\(.state): \(.title)"'
  ```
- The primary issue (from branch name) gets `Closes #N` treatment
- Secondary issues get `Addresses #N` or `Related to #N`

If NO issue references are found, abort: "Every PR must reference at least one GitHub issue. Run `/new-issue` to create one."

### Step 3: Code Quality (parallel, unless --skip-checks)

If `--skip-checks` is passed, warn that this is not recommended and skip to Step 9.

Run all checks in parallel:

**A — Lint:**
```bash
ruff check src/ tests/ 2>&1 | tail -30
```

**B — Format:**
```bash
ruff format --check src/ tests/ 2>&1 | tail -30
```

**C — Unit tests:**
```bash
pytest tests/unit/ -v --tb=short 2>&1 | tail -80
```

**D — Type check:**
```bash
mypy src/ --ignore-missing-imports 2>&1 | tail -30
```

These are **blocking** — if any fail, abort. The user must fix issues before submitting.

### Step 3b: Dependency Health (parallel, unless --skip-checks)

Run dependency health checks in parallel. Launch these concurrently with Steps 4 and 5 — do not wait for 3b to complete before starting Step 4.

**E — Vulnerability audit:**

First check if pip-audit is available:
```bash
which pip-audit 2>/dev/null
```

If not installed, skip with ⏭️ and emit: `⚠️ pip-audit not installed — install with: pip install anteroom[dev]`

If installed, run:
```bash
pip-audit 2>&1 | tail -40
```

This is **blocking** — if known vulnerabilities are found, abort. The user must fix or pin safe versions before submitting.

**F — Outdated dependencies:**
```bash
pip list --outdated --format=json 2>&1
```

Parse the JSON output. This is a **warning** (non-blocking). Report a compact summary:
```
⚠️ Outdated: N packages have newer versions available
   package-name  1.2.3 → 1.3.0
   other-pkg     0.9.1 → 1.0.0
```

If all packages are up to date, report ✅. Limit display to 10 most outdated packages; if more, show count.

**G — New dependency review (conditional):**

Only run this check if `pyproject.toml` is in the diff:
```bash
git diff --name-only $BASE..HEAD -- pyproject.toml
```

If `pyproject.toml` changed:

1. Extract added/changed dependency lines from the diff. Match any added line that looks like a PEP 508 dependency (not just `>=`):
   ```bash
   git diff $BASE..HEAD -- pyproject.toml | grep '^+' | grep -v '^+++' | grep -E '^\+\s*"[a-zA-Z]'
   ```
   Extract the package name from each line (the part before any version specifier: `>=`, `==`, `~=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `[`, or end of string).

2. For each new or changed package, query the PyPI JSON API with error handling:
   ```bash
   curl -s --max-time 5 "https://pypi.org/pypi/<package>/json" | python3 -c "
   import sys, json
   try:
       d = json.load(sys.stdin)
       info = d['info']
       version = info.get('version', 'unknown')
       upload_time = 'unknown'
       if d.get('urls'):
           upload_time = d['urls'][0].get('upload_time', 'unknown')[:10]
       print(f\"License: {info.get('license') or info.get('license_expression') or 'UNKNOWN'}\")
       print(f\"Latest: {version} ({upload_time})\")
       print(f\"Summary: {info.get('summary', 'N/A')}\")
   except Exception:
       print('ERROR: PyPI unreachable or invalid response')
   "
   ```
   If the query fails (ERROR output or curl timeout), report the package as `⚠️ [SKIP] PyPI unavailable` rather than failing.

3. Flag as warning if:
   - License is unknown or empty
   - Last release was more than 2 years ago (possibly abandoned)
   - Package has no summary (minimal metadata)
   - PyPI query failed

This is a **warning** (non-blocking). Report format:
```
📦 New/Changed Dependencies:
  aiohttp (>=3.12.14)  — License: Apache-2.0, Latest: 3.12.14 (2026-01-15) ✅
  obscure-pkg (>=1.0)  — License: UNKNOWN, Latest: 1.0.0 (2022-03-01) ⚠️ stale, no license
  air-gapped-pkg       — ⚠️ [SKIP] PyPI unavailable
```

If `pyproject.toml` was not changed, skip with ⏭️.

**H — Semgrep SAST scan:**

First check if semgrep is available:
```bash
which semgrep 2>/dev/null
```

If not installed, skip with ⏭️ and emit: `⚠️ semgrep not installed — install with: pip install anteroom[dev]`

If installed, run:
```bash
semgrep scan --config p/python --config p/security-audit --json src/ 2>&1
```

Parse the JSON output. Count findings by severity (error, warning, info).

This is **blocking** — if any error-severity findings are found, abort. Warning-severity findings are non-blocking but reported. Report format:
```
🔒 SAST (Semgrep): ✅ no findings / ❌ N error findings, M warnings
   rule-id: description (src/path/file.py:line)
```

### Step 4: Test Coverage for New Code

Check that new or modified Python source files have corresponding unit tests.

1. Get the list of added/modified Python files under `src/`:
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=AM $BASE..HEAD -- 'src/**/*.py'
   ```
2. For each file (e.g., `src/anteroom/services/approvals.py`), check if a corresponding test file exists:
   - Expected location: `tests/unit/test_<module_name>.py` (e.g., `tests/unit/test_approvals.py`)
   - Also check: `tests/unit/test_<parent>_<module>.py` (e.g., `tests/unit/test_services_approvals.py`)
3. For modified files (not new), check if the test file was also modified — warn if source changed but tests didn't.
4. Flag any new Python modules under `src/` that have zero corresponding test files.

Report format:
```
🧪 Test Coverage:
  src/anteroom/services/approvals.py  -> ❌ MISSING (no test file found)
  src/anteroom/routers/chat.py        -> ⚠️ WARNING (source changed, tests unchanged)
  src/anteroom/tools/canvas.py        -> ✅ OK (tests/unit/test_canvas.py exists)
```

### Step 5: Deep Analysis (parallel agents, unless --skip-checks)

Launch 5 parallel agents. Use **Haiku** for Agents C and D (docs freshness, vision alignment — lightweight checks). Use **Sonnet** for Agents A, B, and E (test analysis, compliance, security — require deeper reasoning).

**IMPORTANT for ALL agents:** Report ONLY failures and warnings. Do not report passing checks. Keep response under 500 words.

**Agent A — Test Thoroughness (Sonnet):**

Read the new/modified source files and their corresponding test files. Check:
- [ ] Every public function/method has at least one test
- [ ] Both happy path and error paths covered
- [ ] Branching logic (if/else, try/except) has tests for each branch
- [ ] Async code with locks/futures/timeouts has concurrency tests
- [ ] External dependencies (DB, API, file I/O) are mocked
- [ ] Input validation functions tested with valid and invalid inputs

Rate: GOOD (>80% paths), WEAK (50-80%), POOR (<50%).

**Agent B — CLAUDE.md Compliance (Sonnet):**

Get the diff (`git diff $BASE..HEAD`) and read `CLAUDE.md`. Check:
- [ ] Commit messages follow `type(scope): description (#issue)`
- [ ] Every commit references a GitHub issue
- [ ] New architecturally significant modules documented in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Security patterns followed (parameterized queries, input validation, no hardcoded secrets)
- [ ] New endpoints have auth/CSRF protection

**Agent C — Documentation Freshness (Haiku, Authoritative):**

This is the authoritative doc review — identifies stale/missing docs AND applies fixes.

1. Get changed files: `git diff --name-only $BASE..HEAD`
2. Read `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `VISION.md`, and relevant `docs/` pages
3. Check each surface — flag as MISSING or STALE:

**CLAUDE.md:** New modules not in "Key Modules"? Modified modules with stale descriptions? New config/DB/event fields undocumented? Security model changes not reflected?

**README.md:** The README serves as marketing — it must showcase what Anteroom can do. Check:
- New user-facing features (`feat:` commits) reflected in the "What makes it different" grid or "The full picture" table?
- New CLI commands/flags/modes reflected in the CLI REPL example or exec mode section?
- New tools added to the built-in tools list?
- New MCP capabilities or integration patterns mentioned?
- Feature descriptions stale or misleading after this PR's changes?
- Install instructions still accurate?
- If the PR adds a significant user-visible feature and the README doesn't mention it, flag as STALE.

**VISION.md:** New capabilities not in "Current Direction"? Scope boundary changes?

**docs/ pages:** For each changed source file, check corresponding docs:
- `src/anteroom/cli/` → `docs/cli/`, `routers/` → `docs/api/` + `docs/web-ui/`, `tools/` → `docs/cli/tools.md`, `config.py` → `docs/configuration/`, security → `docs/security/`, `app.py` → `docs/security/` + `docs/advanced/architecture.md`

**a-help skill** (`src/anteroom/cli/default_skills/a-help.yaml`): This is the inline quick-reference that ships with Anteroom. If any of the following source files changed, verify the corresponding a-help sections are current:
- `tools/__init__.py` or `tools/*.py` → Built-in Tools table (tool names, descriptions, tiers)
- `__main__.py` → CLI Flags table (all argparse flags)
- `cli/commands.py` or `cli/repl.py` → REPL Commands table (slash commands)
- `config.py` → Configuration Sections table (all dataclass fields and defaults)
- `docs/` → Documentation Index (file list and descriptions)
- If a-help is stale, update it directly. Cross-check against the actual source files, not just the diff.

4. **Apply fixes** for MISSING/STALE items directly.
5. Rate: UP TO DATE / FIXED (list files) / NEEDS MANUAL REVIEW.

**Agent D — Vision Alignment (Haiku):**

Read `VISION.md` and the diff (`git diff $BASE..HEAD`). Check:
- [ ] Not a walled garden / ChatGPT clone / config burden / enterprise software / deployment project / model host
- [ ] New `pyproject.toml` dependencies justified
- [ ] New config options have sensible defaults
- [ ] New infra requirements degrade gracefully
- [ ] Dual-interface parity (web-only or CLI-only justified?)
- [ ] Lean: could this be simpler? Unnecessary abstractions?

Flag only issues **introduced by this PR**, not pre-existing patterns.

**Agent E — Security Scan, OWASP ASVS Level 2 (Sonnet):**

Get the diff (`git diff $BASE..HEAD`) and read modified Python/JS files. Check:
- [ ] **SQL injection**: No string formatting in queries (parameterized only)
- [ ] **Command injection**: No `subprocess` with `shell=True` + user input
- [ ] **Path traversal**: File ops validate paths (no unsanitized `..`)
- [ ] **XSS**: No `innerHTML` with unsanitized input
- [ ] **CSRF**: State-changing endpoints have CSRF protection
- [ ] **Auth bypass**: New endpoints require authentication
- [ ] **Hardcoded secrets**: No API keys/passwords/tokens in source
- [ ] **Insecure defaults**: No debug mode, disabled auth, permissive CORS, skipped TLS verification
- [ ] **Input validation**: User input validated server-side at boundaries
- [ ] **Info disclosure**: Error messages don't reveal internals
- [ ] **Unsafe deserialization**: No `pickle.loads`, `yaml.load`, `eval()`, `exec()` with external input
- [ ] **Cookie security**: New cookies have HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite
- [ ] **Rate limiting**: New public endpoints have rate limits
- [ ] **Content-Type**: Endpoints validate Content-Type headers

### Step 6: Commit Documentation Fixes

If Agent C in Step 5 flagged documentation as FIXED (it applied updates to CLAUDE.md, README.md, VISION.md, or docs/ pages):

1. Stage and commit the doc fixes. Extract the primary issue number from the branch name:
   ```bash
   git add CLAUDE.md README.md VISION.md docs/ src/anteroom/cli/default_skills/a-help.yaml
   git commit -m "docs: update documentation for current changes (#<primary issue>)"
   ```
2. Update the validation report to show docs as fixed rather than stale.

If Agent C rated docs as UP TO DATE, skip this step. If NEEDS MANUAL REVIEW, flag in the report but do not block PR creation.

### Step 7: GitHub Issue Check

Verify all commits reference a GitHub issue:
```bash
git log --oneline $BASE..HEAD
```

For each commit, check that it contains `(#N)` where N is a valid issue number. For any referenced issues, verify they exist:
```bash
gh issue view <N> --json state,title --jq '"\(.state): \(.title)"'
```

### Step 8: Display Validation Report

Display the full validation results locally in the chat:

### Step 9: Generate PR Description

Analyze all commits and changed files to generate the PR body:

```bash
git log --format='%s%n%b' main..HEAD
git diff --stat main..HEAD
git diff main..HEAD
```

Structure the PR body:

```markdown
## Summary

<2-4 bullet points describing what this PR does and why, written for a reviewer>

## Changes

<Grouped by area — routers, services, tools, tests, etc.>

### <Area>
- `file.py` — <what changed and why>

## Issue References

Closes #<primary issue>
Addresses #<secondary issue>

## Test Plan

- [ ] Unit tests pass: `pytest tests/unit/ -v`
- [ ] Lint passes: `ruff check src/ tests/`
- [ ] <Specific test scenarios relevant to this PR>
- [ ] <Manual verification steps if applicable>

## Security Considerations

<Only include if the PR touches auth, sessions, input handling, DB queries, or tool execution. Otherwise omit this section.>

## Vision Alignment

<Include a brief note on which core principles this PR supports. If the PR adds new dependencies, config options, or infrastructure requirements, note them here with justification. Omit this section for trivial changes (typos, small fixes).>

## Documentation

<If the validation report flagged stale or missing docs, list them here as action items. Otherwise omit this section.>

### Step 10: Push and Create PR

```bash
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

Then create the PR:

```bash
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<generated body>
EOF
)" <--draft if requested>
```

**Title rules:**
- Under 70 characters
- Format: `<type>: <description> (#<primary issue>)`
- Derived from the primary issue title or the commit summary
- Examples: `feat: add semantic search to CLI (#83)`, `fix: handle empty query in search endpoint (#91)`

### Step 10b: Transition Issue Labels

After the PR is created, transition the primary issue's label from `in-progress` to `ready-for-review`:

1. Extract the primary issue number from the branch name (`issue-<N>-...`)
2. Ensure the `ready-for-review` label exists:
   ```bash
   gh label create "ready-for-review" --color "0075CA" --description "PR submitted" --force
   ```
3. Transition the label:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <N> --remove-label "in-progress" --add-label "ready-for-review"
   ```

### Step 11: Post-creation Report

```bash
gh pr view --json number,url,title
```

```

```

### Step 12: Automatic Code Review

Immediately after PR creation, run the full `/code-review` workflow on the new PR. Display the local review report in chat and post the condensed comment to the PR.

### Step 13: Fix Loop (if issues found)

If the code review finds issues (score 80+):

1. Display all issues with full context
2. Ask the user:

```
────────────────────────────────────────────
  🔧 Code review found N issues.

  Options:
    → Fix all — auto-fix what I can, then re-review
    → Fix specific — tell me which to fix
    → Skip — leave as-is for a human reviewer
────────────────────────────────────────────
```

3. **If "Fix all" or "Fix specific":**
   - Apply fixes to the code
   - Run lint + format + tests to verify fixes don't break anything
   - Stage and commit: `fix(scope): address code review feedback (#<issue>)`
   - Push: `git push`
   - Re-run the code review
   - If new issues are found, repeat (max 2 fix rounds to avoid infinite loops)
   - Post an updated review comment to the PR

4. **If "Skip":**
   - Proceed without fixing. The review comment is already posted.

### Step 14: Final Summary

## Guidelines

- Never create a PR without at least one issue reference
- Never create a PR with failing tests (unless --skip-checks)
- Keep the PR title concise — details go in the body
- Group changes logically in the description
- If the PR is large (>500 lines changed), suggest breaking it up
- Security section only when relevant — don't add boilerplate
- Documentation issues are auto-fixed and committed before PR creation when possible
- Documentation items that need manual review don't block PR creation, but are flagged in the PR body
